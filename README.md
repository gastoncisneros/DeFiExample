# Sample DeFi Project using AAVE protocol

1. Deposit Collateral: ETH/WETH (Wrapped ETH).
2. Borrow another asset: DAI
3. Repay the DAI

We'll use Uniswap to exchange tokens: ETH => WETH, etc.

AAVE treats everything as an ERC-20 token, so we use WETH as if it is ETH.

We'll use Scripts to interact with the protocols (AAVE, Uniswap).
